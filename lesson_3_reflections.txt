When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A) When I need to share my work with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?
B) Because we want to work on our own codes at our pace.

Describe the differences between forks, clone and branches. When would you use one instead
of another?
C) Fork is a purely GitHub concept to copy someone else's repository on your account. Clone
is to make a copy of a repository between your GitHub account and your local machine, or
on a local machine. Branch is a stream of commits that helps you when working on some experimental
or different version of programs.
